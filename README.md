# C-space-and-A-
*) Understand different types of motion planning problems and properties of motion planners.
*) Apply the concept of C-space obstacles in the analysis of motion planning.
*) Represent free C-space as a graph or a tree.
*) Implement the A* optimal graph search algorithm.
*) Understand how a roadmap representation of the free C-space allows the design of a path planner that is guaranteed to find a path when one exists (a "complete" planner).
